The goal was to build a  browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The full details are here [Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery)

Key specs:
1.Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
2. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.
3.Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid (changed this a bit becuase I hate the javascript prompt, so you can enter the grid size in a box and click resize me)
4.Have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. (I have a dropdown with a few colors and a random mode)
5.Try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black. (Added an opacity toggle)

Things I could improve: 
	-add a shake effect to the screen 
    -change the two dials to div elements instead of rather ugly buttons
    -add round pixels instead of squares
    -add a slide menu
